# Update a movie

1. Render a form that, on submitting, updates a movie.
    - <details>
            <summary><em>How should I approach this?</em></summary>
            <br>
            There are a few ways you can do it. One could be to display a single form with a select drop-down to choose the movie to edit. Another could be to allow clicking on a movie to display a form under it.
        </details>

2. Update the list of movies in state to reflect the changes made to the movie so the displayed list re-renders.
