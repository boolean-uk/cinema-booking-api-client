# Movie List



1. When the `App` component mounts, retrieve a list of movies from your API and store them in state.
    - <details>
        <summary><em>How should I approach this?</em></summary>
        <br>
        You'll need to import and use the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks. Inside the useEffect, use the `fetch` function to interact with your API.
        <br><br>
        Remember to use console logs to provide visibility as you build.
    </details>

2. Render a list of movies.
