# Cinema Booking API Client

## Learning Objectives

- Use your own API in a client-side application.
- Identify improvements that can be made to your API.

## Introduction

This exercise asks you to create a very simple React application that interacts with your API. Although you can create components and organise your code if you like, it's acceptable to do all of your work inside `src/App.js`. The focus of this exercise is on interacting with your API.

## Setting up

- Fork this repository and clone the fork.
- Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to run the application.

## Instructions

- Work through each file in the `requirements` directory in numerical order.
- Take notes of improvements that could be made to your API as you work through this exercise, use [NOTES.md](./NOTES.md) to record these.
- React has already been set up so you can begin writing code in `src/App.js`.
- You will have to run your API as well as running this project for them to be able to communicate with each other.
